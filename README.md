how to build and run using Android Studio
1. Clone using Android Studio
2. connect iPhone or Android phone
3. run main.dart
4. run tests in unit_test.dart for testing

There is an APK (apk-release.apk) file in the main folder for you to directly install in the Android phone, no IPA provided because I dont have distribution account.

I also attached a screen record demo (demo.mp4) in the main folder.
